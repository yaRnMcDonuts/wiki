There are currently two ways to request to have your games or projects featured on JME's official pages:

* Opting in to the Marketing Pool
* Making Unique Marketing Requests


=== 1.) Opt-in to the Marketing Pool:
Each jME user/studio can submit a specific project to be listed in the JME Marketing Pool, and these projects will be routinely posted in as fair of a rotation as possible.  

The current marketing pool can be found here: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/19ib-riULtnyA7_-heG-rHTKv9L0QF7DOKvgbua9aMpI/edit?usp=sharing

And you can opt-in by posting to the jME Marketing Thread with the following information about your project:


* Project Name
* Where To Link to
* Best place(s) to find Media
* Extra Notes (optional)

===== Submission Example:

**Project Name**: The Afflicted Forests

**Where To Link to**: https://store.steampowered.com/app/972120/The_Afflicted_Forests

**Best places to find Media**: TheAfflictedForests.com, IndieDB, Twitter, YouTube

**Extra Notes**: Coming soon to Steam; currently in closed beta; can contact developer for beta keys


TIP: Be sure to provide links to as many media sources as possible for your project. By provoding more easily accessible media, you can increase the likelihood and frequenecy that the marketing manager will select your content.



=== 2.) Unique Marketing Requests:
You may also submit a request to the jME Marketing Thread providing a curated post with some accompanying images or videos that you want posted. 

The Marketing Manager still reserves the right to make some edits or deny requests altogether. 
It is best to submit one complete entry per month to help keep things running smoothly.

TIP: Whenever your project hits a big milestone, like a game launch or a major new feature, consider sending a Unique Marketing Request. Since the Marketing Manager is usually picking from the Marketing Pool, things can sometimes slip through the cracks. This is the best way to make sure your big updates get noticed!

== Content Posted in jME's Monthly WIP (Work in Progress) Threads

Any media posted by users in the Monthly WIP Threads on the official jME forum (hub.jmonkeyengine.org) may be shared on jMEâ€™s social media channels, unless users explicitly request otherwise by contacting the Marketing Manager or by writing `noshare` at the end of their post.

TIP: Higher priority is given to direct requests, so you should still make requests when you want to ensure that your content is featured more often.

=== What is posted to each platform?

The majority of posts will be made to Twitter, Bluesky, LinkedIn, Facebook, and Nostr. 
These platforms all have similar functionality and are receptive to the widest range of media, whether it be purely text-based posts or images and videos. This allows the same post to be
copied and pasted to all of these locations. Some edits or minor changes may be made depending on the platform (for example, some platforms have significantly lower character limits, and some 
platforms such as LinkedIn prioritize speaking with professionalism whereas others like Twitter are more casual).

Instagram and YouTube will be limited to posting polished trailers of jME games that have reached a major milestone, such as release or pre-order announcements.
