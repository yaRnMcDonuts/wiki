There are currently two ways to request to have your games or projects featured on JME's official pages:

* Opting in to the Marketing Pool
* Making Unique Marketing Requests


=== 1.) Opt-in to the Marketing Pool:
Each jME user/studio can submit a specific project to be listed in the JME Marketing Pool, and these projects will be routinely posted in as fair of a rotation as possible.  

The current rotation can be found here: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/19ib-riULtnyA7_-heG-rHTKv9L0QF7DOKvgbua9aMpI/edit?usp=sharing

And you can opt-in by posting to the jME Marketing Thread with the following information:


* Project Name
* Where To Link to
* Best place(s) to find Media
* Extra Notes (optional)
* End date (optional)


===== Submission Example:

**Project Name**: The Afflicted Forests

**Where To Link to**: https://store.steampowered.com/app/972120/The_Afflicted_Forests

**Best places to find Media**: TheAfflictedForests.com, IndieDB, Twitter, YouTube

**Extra Notes**: Coming soon to Steam; currently in closed beta; can contact developer for beta keys


TIP: Be sure to provide links to as many media sources as possible for your project.



=== 2.) Unique Marketing Requests:
You may also submit a request to the jME Marketing Thread providing a curated post with some accompanying images or videos that you want posted. 

The Marketing Manager still reserves the right to make some edits or deny requests altogether. Submitting too many requests from the same user/studio in the same month may also a longer wait time for the posts to be made, especially if many other projects are in the queue waiting to be posted. 

TIP: Users are encouraged to make Unique Marketing Requests whenever your project has reached a major milestone that warrants a timely announcement, such as a game that was just released or that has just had a major feature finished. The Marketing Manager may unintentionally overlook these things when routinely selecting content to post from projects that are in the Marketing Pool, so Unique Marketing Requests are the best way to ensure that something important is put in the spotlight and not overlooked.

== Content Posted in jME's Monthly WIP (Work in Progress) Threads

Any media that users post to any Monthly WIP Thread on the official jME forums (hub.jmonkeyengine.org) may be have their media selected and used for marketing or promotional reasons, unless explicitly requests otherwise (contact the Marketing Manager to make this request). 

So if you post something particuarily cool in the monthly WIP thread, it may be reposted on jME's social media pages without you having to make any requests. However higher priority will be given to users and projects that make direct requests, so you should still make requests when you want to ensure that your content is featured more often.

=== What is posted to each platform?

The majority of posts will be made to Twitter, Bluesky, LinkedIn, Facebook, and Nostr. 
These platforms all have similar functionality and are receptive to the widest range of media, whether it be purely text-based posts or images and videos. This allows the same post to be
copied and pasted to all of these locations. Some edits or minor changes may be made depending on the platform (for example, some platforms have significantly lower character limits, and some 
platforms such as LinkedIn prioritize speaking with professionalism whereas others like Twitter are more casual).

Instagram and YouTube will be limited to posting polished trailers of jME games that have reached a major milestone, such as release or pre-order announcements. 


== Role of the Marketing Manager

When choosing which projects to post, the Marketing Manager should always strive to be fair in their selections while also prioritizing posts that paint jME in the best light possible. 

The Marketing Manager should be receptive to reasonable criticisms or questioning from users that may feel dissatisfied with the
Marketing Manager's decisions regarding which projects to prioritize. Likewise, jME users should be receptive to feedback and reasonable criticisms from the Marketing Manager when resolving any disputes that may arise. Any unresolvable disputes
should be brought up on the jMonkey hub so that the community can share their opinions and make a democratic judgment in order to resolve the dispute.



In the event that the Marketing Manager role is vacant, someone else is encouraged to volunteer to fill the role. Large gaps in posting are severely frowned upon by
every social media platform, and even an occasional weekly or monthly post is better than nothing and requires very low effort. 

Login information for all of these platforms is linked to the engine's official project email address, and any future Marketing Managers can obtain this information by contacting a past Marketing Manager or Engine Leader.
